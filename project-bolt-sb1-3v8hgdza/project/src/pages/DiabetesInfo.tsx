      title: 'Cardiovascular Disease',

  const managementTips = [
    'Monitor Blood Sugar Regularly — Check glucose levels as recommended by your doctor. Keeping records helps identify patterns and triggers.',
    'Take Medications as Prescribed — Whether insulin or oral medications, consistency is key. Never skip doses without consulting your healthcare provider.',
    'Follow a Balanced Diet — Focus on whole grains, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Limit processed foods, refined sugars, and high-sodium options.',
    'Stay Active — Regular physical activity helps lower blood sugar and improves insulin sensitivity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days.',
    'Attend Regular Check-Ups — See your doctor regularly to monitor A1C levels, kidney function, eye health, and foot health.',
    'Manage Stress — Stress raises blood sugar. Mindfulness, exercise, and adequate sleep all help manage stress levels.',
    'Know the Signs of Low and High Blood Sugar — Learn to recognize hypoglycemia (shakiness, sweating, confusion) and hyperglycemia (excessive thirst, frequent urination) so you can act quickly.'

  const preventionTips = [
    'Maintain a Healthy Weight — Even modest weight loss (5–10% of body weight) can significantly reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.',
    'Eat a Nutritious Diet — Prioritize fiber-rich foods, whole grains, and vegetables. Limit sugary beverages and highly processed foods.',
    'Exercise Regularly — Physical activity helps your body use insulin more efficiently. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week.',
    'Get Regular Health Screenings — Blood sugar screenings can catch prediabetes early, allowing for lifestyle changes before Type 2 diabetes develops.',
    'Limit Alcohol and Avoid Smoking — Both increase the risk of diabetes complications and metabolic dysfunction.',
    'Stay Informed — Know your family history. Those with a family history of diabetes should be especially proactive about healthy lifestyle habits and regular screenings.'
