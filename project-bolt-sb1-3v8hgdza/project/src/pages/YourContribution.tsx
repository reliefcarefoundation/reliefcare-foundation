              For many people living with diabetes, access to insulin and supplies isn't just about managing a condition — it's about survival. The cost of diabetes care can be overwhelming, forcing patients to make impossible choices between medication and other basic needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your contribution directly addresses this crisis. When you support Relief Care Foundation, you're providing a patient with the insulin they need to stay alive. You're giving a family access to glucose monitors that help prevent dangerous complications. You're funding education programs that teach people how to navigate insurance coverage and manage their condition effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond the immediate medical support, your donation reduces the financial burden on families already stretched thin. It provides peace of mind. It offers hope. It demonstrates that their community cares about their wellbeing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every dollar you give creates a ripple effect — improving health outcomes, reducing emergency room visits, preventing complications, and ultimately saving lives. This is the real, human impact of your generosity.
